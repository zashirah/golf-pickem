- **Docker Support**: Containerization for easy deployment
- **Git Configuration**: Comprehensive .gitignore for FastHTML projects
- **Virtual Environment**: Isolated Python environment with venv

### ✅ Database Schema
Complete database structure with the following tables:
- `users` - User accounts with authentication (id, username, email, password_hash, created_at)
- `sessions` - User session management (id, user_id, session_token, created_at, expires_at)
- `tournaments` - Tournament information (id, name, current, allow_submissions, created_at)
- `picks` - User pick submissions (id, pickname, tier1-4_pick, tournament_id, created_at)
- `golfers` - Master golfer list (id, name, created_at)
- `tournament_golfers` - Tournament field with tiers (id, tournament, player_name, tier, created_at)
- `tournament_leaderboard` - Live tournament scores (id, tournament, player_name, round, strokes, score, updated_at)
- `pickem_leaderboard` - Pick'em standings (id, pickname, tier picks/scores, total_score, updated_at)

### ✅ UI/UX Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with custom CSS
- **Modern Styling**: Professional appearance with consistent theming
- **Authentication UI**: Clean login/registration forms with validation
- **Protected Access**: Tournament management restricted to authenticated users

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Make setup script executable and run it
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# 2. Start the development server
python run_dev.py

# 3. Open your browser
# Navigate to: http://localhost:5001
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run the application
python main.py
```
